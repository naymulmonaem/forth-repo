        <p id="russia"><i>Baseball</i> is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each,
            taking turns batting and fielding. <strong>The game occurs over the course of several 
            plays, with each play generally beginning when</strong> a player on the fielding team, 
            called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the 
            batter, tries to hit with a bat.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">CLICK HERE</a> The objective of the offensive team (batting team) 
            is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, 
            allowing its players to run the bases, <small>having them advance</small> counter-clockwise 
            around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive
            team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming 
            runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored 
            when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter)
